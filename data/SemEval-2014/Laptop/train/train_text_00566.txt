All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating - my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
