Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly - configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher - quality components that are faster , better - configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
