ARLINGTON , Texas 1996-08-31 
Juan Gonzalez homered twice and Ivan Rodriguez added a two-run shot as the Texas Rangers defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders Friday . 
Rodriguez 's 18th homer , off Chad Ogea ( 7-5 ) in the first , gave Texas a 2-0 lead . 
One out later , Gonzalez smacked his 40th homer , extending his hitting streak to 20 games .

Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra 's team record of 119 set in 1989 . 
The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped . 
" It 's not something I 'm going to try to explain , " said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season . 
" We 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season . "
