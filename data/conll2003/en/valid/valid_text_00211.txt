ROME 1996-08-31 
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Saturday met former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere , the international negotiator for Burundi , the ministry said . 
Nyerere arrived in Rome this week on a private visit and held talks with the U.S. special envoy to Burundi , Howard Wolpe , and the Sant ' Egidio Community , an Italian Roman Catholic organisation which has been monitoring Burundi closely . 
" ( Nyerere ) informed Minister Dini of the latest developments in the ( Great Lakes ) region , with particular respect to Burundi following the military coup d'etat on July 25 , " the ministry said in a statement . 
It gave no details of their talks . 
Nyerere was due to be presented with an " Artisans for Peace " prize by the Lay Volunteers ' International Organisation on Sunday . 
He leaves Rome on Monday . 
The U.N. Security Council on Friday condemned the coup by retired Tutsi major Pierre Buyoya and for the first time said in a resolution it intended to pressure Buyoya into unconditional negotiations with all parties and factions " without exception " . 
Buyoya on Saturday dismissed its threat of an arms embargo against Burundi and flatly ruled out talks with Hutu rebels . 
Some 150,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have died in Burundi since 1993 when the country 's first democratically elected Hutu president was killed in an attempted army coup .
