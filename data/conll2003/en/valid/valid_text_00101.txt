SOCCER - REAL SCRAPE 1-1 DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH . 
LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31 
A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday . 
The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna . 
Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato . 
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . 
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time . 
Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o . 
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick . 
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe . 
In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .
