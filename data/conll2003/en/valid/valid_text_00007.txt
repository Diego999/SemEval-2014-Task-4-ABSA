Rotor Volgograd must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at Dynamo Moscow players during a 1-0 home defeat on Saturday that ended Rotor 's brief spell as league leaders . 
The head of the Russian league 's disciplinary committee , Anatoly Gorokhovsky , said on Friday that Rotor would play Lada Togliatti to empty stands on September 3 . 
The club , who put Manchester United out of last year 's UEFA Cup , were fined $ 1,000 . 
Despite the defeat , Rotor are well placed with 11 games to play in the championship . 
Lying three points behind Alania and two behind Dynamo Moscow , the Volgograd side have a game in hand over the leaders and two over the Moscow club .
