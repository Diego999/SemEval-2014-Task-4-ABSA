" We do n't know yet . 
It 's too early to tell , " she said . 
The girl was abducted from her school in Velten near Berlin on Monday . 
German police suspected her aunt , 47 , and companion , 28 , were involved in running a child prostitution ring . 
Public prosecutors said they had found a list of children 's names and ages at the couple 's flat .
