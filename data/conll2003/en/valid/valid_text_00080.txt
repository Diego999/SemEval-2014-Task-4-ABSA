Syria slams Israel on settlements . 
DAMASCUS 1996-08-30 
Syria on Friday condemned Israel 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing for war with Arabs . 
" Practices of the Israeli government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause , " state-run Damascus Radio said in a commentary . 
" When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said . 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war . 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move . 
The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government . 
" Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " Damascus radio said . 
It welcomed the international criticism of Israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy . 
" It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said . 
Syria and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on Jerusalem as a unifed capital for Israel . 
Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough .
