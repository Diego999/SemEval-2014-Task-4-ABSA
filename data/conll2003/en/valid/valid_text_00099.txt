Arafat goes to Nablus ahead of cabinet meeting . 
NABLUS , West Bank 1996-08-30 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in the West Bank self-rule enclave of Nablus from Ramallah on Friday , witnesses said . 
His aides said Arafat would hold the weekly meeting of the Palestinian self-rule Authority 's cabinet in Nablus on Saturday . 
In Jerusalem , Israeli security forces were bracing for thousands of Palestinians expected to answer Arafat 's call earlier this week to come to the city holy to Moslems , Arabs and Jews to pray in protest against Israel 's settlement policy in the West Bank and delay in peace negotiations . 
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state . 
Israel , which captured and annexed East Jerusalem in 1967 , says it will never cede any part of the city . 
Arafat , who made an interim peace deal with Israel in 1993 that set up self-rule , says he will only visit Jerusalem once Israeli occupation has ended .
