This year 's Fed Cup finalists -- defending champion Spain and the United States -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open . 
Spain travels to Belgium , while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2 . 
The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan . 
The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 . 
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City . 
" Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup , " U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw . " 
That is our sole goal . " 
The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April , and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals . 
The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles , who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994 . 
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again . 
" I told Monica we need her if we want to win , " King said . 
Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match . 
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open . 
" We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said King . " 
What we like would be Seles , ( Olympic champion Lindsay ) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez . " 
If she can get that threesome together , King will feel good about her chances against the Spain 's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez . 
" To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , " said King .
