SOCCER - IRISH ERASE PAINFUL MEMORIES WITH 5-0 WIN . 
ESCHEN , Liechtenstein 1996-08-31 
The Republic of Ireland 's new-look side dispelled painful memories of their last visit to Liechtenstein by beating the Alpine part-timers 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday . 
The Irish , under new manager Mick McCarthy , took a 4-0 lead within 20 minutes through captain Andy Townsend , 20-year-old Norwich striker Keith O'Neill , Sunderland forward Niall Quinn and teenager Ian Harte . 
Quinn added his second and Ireland 's fifth just after the hour to complete the rout and give the Irish their biggest-ever away win . 
The result helped erase memories of Ireland 's visit to the Eschen stadium 14 months ago , when Jack Charlton 's side were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw which ultimately cost them a place in the European championship finals .
