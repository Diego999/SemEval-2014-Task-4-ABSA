WARSAW 1996-08-30 
Poland 's Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati will visit Yugoslavia on September 3 and 4 to revive a dialogue between the two governments which was effectively frozen in 1992 , PAP news agency reported on Friday . 
During Rosati 's trip the two countries will sign an agreement on mutual protection of investments and a note easing conditions on the granting of visas , the agency quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying . 
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only country of the former Yugoslavia where Poles currently require visas . 
They are also to clinch protocols on culture and understanding between the two foreign ministries . 
Rosati will meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav politicians in Belgrade , before visiting Montenegro . 
Poland revived diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level with Yugoslavia in April but economic links are almost moribund , despite the end of a three-year U.N. trade embargo imposed to punish Belgrade for its support of Bosnian Serbs . 
Poland is seeking pacts on avoiding double taxation and wants cooperation in fighting crime .
