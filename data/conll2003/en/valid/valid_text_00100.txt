U.N. Council concerned about Israeli bulldozers . 
UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-29 
Security Council members expressed concern on Thursday that Israel 's bulldozing of a Palestinian day-care centre for the disabled might further injure the Middle East peace process . 
Responding to a letter from the the Palestinian U.N. observer mission , Security Council President Tono Eitel of Germany said that members asked him to convey their views to Israel 's charge d'affaires , David Peleg . 
" The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , " Eitel said after an informal council session . 
" They asked me to call in the Israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , " he added . 
The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem " and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation . 
" This most recent measure represents a revival of old , malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for Israeli settlers within the walls of the Old City . " 
" We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with U.N. resolutions , against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices , " he said . 
On Tuesday , Israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem 's old city and demolished the centre , saying it was being restored without a building permit . 
Canada had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre , called the Burj al-Laqlaq Society .
