UK meals / feeds follow Chicago higher , trade slow . 
LONDON 1996-08-30 
UK meals and feeds sellers marked up high protein soymeal by around 1.50 stg a tonne on Friday following gains in Chicago at Thursday 's close . 
Trade was very quiet with only one deal reported when spot high protein soymeal fetched 215 stg a tonne ex-store on the south coast . 
" I would n't get too excited about this one becuase I think it 's for all of five tonnes , which when you think about just about sums up the state of the market at the moment , " said a trader .
