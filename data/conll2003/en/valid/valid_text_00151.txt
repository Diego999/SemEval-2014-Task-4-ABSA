CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 
Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday . 
Brown ( 14-10 ) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 .

Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season . 
" Bolesy ( Florida manager John Boles ) told me yesterday , ' You have to go nine tomorrow , ' " Brown said . 
" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . 
I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . 
I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . " 
" He has a devastating sinker , " observed Reds manager Ray Knight . " 
The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league . 
I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( Tom ) Seaver and ( Jerry ) Koosman when they were starting . "
