SOCCER - SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN . 
LONDON 1996-08-30 
The world 's costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday . 
The 26-year-old , who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from Tony Adams , who led the side during the European championship in June , and former captain David Platt . 
Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England 's opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday . 
Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own . 
" I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job , " Hoddle said . 
" There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it . 
" In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ... 
but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . " 
Shearer 's Euro 96 striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday . 
He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand .
