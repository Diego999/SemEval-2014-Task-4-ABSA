NATO monitors Moslem move towards tense village . 
MAHALA , Bosnia 1996-08-31 
NATO said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 Moslem men towards the village of Mahala in Bosnia 's Serb republic on Saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with Serbs . 
" I have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ... 
that up to 75 Moslem men are believed to be approaching Mahala , " NATO spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner said in Sarajevo . 
Marriner said that NATO troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between Tuzla and Mahala to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village . 
Mahala is a Moslem village on Bosnian Serb republic territory . 
Moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month Bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed . 
Some Moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week . 
Fights and shooting broke out between the Moslems and Serb police on Thursday and NATO troops finally brought restored order . 
A Reuters reporter who entered Mahala on Saturday morning found it tranquil but NATO troops and U.N. police were seen on the ground and NATO helicopters flew overhead .
