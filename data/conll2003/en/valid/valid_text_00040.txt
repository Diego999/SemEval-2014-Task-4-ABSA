Boxing-Bruno quits on doctor 's advice . 
LONDON 1996-08-30 
Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno has quit the ring on medical advice , Britain 's Sun newspaper reported on Friday . 
An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again , the newspaper said . 
The Briton , who lost his World Boxing Council ( WBC ) title to Mike Tyson in March , said : " I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in . 
" I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I 'm glad I had a good innings . " 
Bruno , for years one of Britain 's most popular sportsmen , had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye . 
Professor David McLeod , who examined Bruno , told the Sun : " There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again . 
He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that . " 
Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995 . 
He was only the third Briton ever to hold a world heavyweight title . 
But Bruno lost the title on his first defence when he fought American Tyson in Las Vegas . 
Bruno suffered a cut eye in the opening round and the referee stopped the fight in the third as the Briton crumbled under a flurry of punches .
