China police detains dissident Wang Donghai . 
BEIJING 1996-08-31 
Chinese police have detained dissident Wang Donghai , the New York-based pressure group Human Rights in China said on Saturday . 
Police detained Wang on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held , the group said . 
The pressure group said Wang would be sent to a study class , often a euphemism in China for ideological reform . 
Wang 's family could not immediately be reached for comment . 
Last month , Wang , 45 , a veteran dissident of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement , was ordered to serve one year of " re-education through labour " , but released because of poor health . 
Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts . 
Wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military brutally crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life .
