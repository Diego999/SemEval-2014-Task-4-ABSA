BOXING - KNOCK-OUT SPECIALIST MILLER DEFENDS TITLE . 
DUBLIN 1996-08-31 
A powerful right hook followed by a straight left gave defending champion Nate Miller a seventh round knock-out win over fellow American James Heath in their WBA cruiserweight title bout on Saturday . 
Miller , who went into the contest with a record of 24 knock-out wins in 32 fights , took charge from the opening bell and had his opponent on the canvas inside 90 seconds when he landed a deft left-hook to the head . 
Heath did score with two brusing lefts to Miller 's head in the third round but failed to put his opponent under any real pressure . 
Miller raised the pace of the contest at the start of the fifth round and , once he started to get his right-left combinations working for him , the fight was never likely to go the distance .
