North Korea demanded on Saturday that South Korea return a northern war veteran who has been in the South since the 1950-53 war , Seoul 's unification ministry said . 
" ...I request the immediate repatriation of Kim In-so to North Korea where his family is waiting , " North Korean Red Cross president Li Song-ho said in a telephone message to his southern couterpart , Kang Young-hoon . 
Li said Kim had been critically ill with a cerebral haemorrhage . 
The message was distributed to the press by the South Korean unification ministry . 
Kim , an unrepentant communist , was captured during the Korean War and released after spending more than 30 years in a southern jail . 
He submitted a petition to the International Red Cross in 1993 asking for his repatriation .
