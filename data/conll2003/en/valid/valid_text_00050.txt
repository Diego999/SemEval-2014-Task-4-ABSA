Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday . 
The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . 
He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . 
Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron . 
Tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins . 
Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . 
The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . 
Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups . 
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire . 
Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . 
Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . 
" Help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . 
The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . 
" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt . 
Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . 
They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . 
One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . 
He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . " 
It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , " he said .
