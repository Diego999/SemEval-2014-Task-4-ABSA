PARIS 1996-08-31 
A bomb explosion in a restaurant west of Algiers on Friday killed seven people , an Algerian newspaper said on Saturday . 
Algerian security forces said in a statement that two people were killed and six were wounded when a home-made bomb ripped through a restaurant in the coastal town of Staoueli . 
But Le Matin newspaper , quoting witnesses , said the bomb killed seven people and wounded 20 . 
Liberte newspaper said the bomb was hidden in a bag in front of the restaurant and that a booby-trapped car was defused near the restaurant shortly before the bomb went off . 
A week ago a home-made bomb exploded in a market in the western coastal town of Bou Haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) from Algiers . 
Newspapers said it killed two women and five children . 
Algerian newspapers quoted the Human Rights National Observatory ( ONDH ) , a government-appointed watchdog , as saying earlier in August that about 1,400 civilians had been killed in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem guerrillas in the past two years . 
An estimated 50,000 people have died in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .
