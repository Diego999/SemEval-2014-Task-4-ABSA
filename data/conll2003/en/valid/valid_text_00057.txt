BOGOTA , Colombia 1996-08-30 
Eight claymore mines fitted with powerful C-4 plastic explosives were found stashed in a real estate office on Friday located about two blocks from Colombia 's presidential palace , police said . 
" These are powerful weapons , " a spokesman with the Municipal Police told Reuters by telephone , adding that police had not ruled out a possible terrorist attack on the ornate Casa de Narino presidential palace in Bogota 's historic downtown area . 
" They could cause serious damage as much as 500 meters ( yards ) away from wherever they were detonated , " the spokesman added . 
He said police backed by explosive experts were combing the area in search of other possible weapons or explosive devices . 
The police spokeman said plastic explosive like C-4 is not a normal component in claymore mines . 
But he said the eight mines seized by police had been " specially adapted . " 
The spokesman declined further comment , except to say that two women and a man identified as a lawyer had been arrested in connection with the landmines .
