MOSCOW 1996-08-30 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited his wife Naina in hospital on Friday evening , Interfax news agency quoted spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying . 
Naina Yeltsin had a kidney operation last Saturday . 
Earlier Russian news reports had said Yeltsin 's children and grandchildren had visited the Russian first lady but they said only that Yeltsin , on vacation outside Moscow , had spoken to her by telephone . 
" Naina Yeltsin looks well , she is active , she is clearly getting better , " Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying . 
Naina Yeltsin is recovering in Moscow 's Central Clinical Hospital , where the president himself was treated twice last year for heart attacks . 
Yeltsin , 65 , has been seen only rarely since he was elected for a second term in office on July 3 , although his aides have denied a string of rumours that he has been taken ill again . 
Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had travelled from the hospital to spend the night at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow . 
He was likely to return on Saturday to his holiday resort , a hunting lodge some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from Moscow .
