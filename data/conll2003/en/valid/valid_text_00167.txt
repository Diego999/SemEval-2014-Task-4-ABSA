BONN 1996-08-31 
German international striker Juergen Klinsmann has said he will retire after the 1998 World Cup in France . 
" For myself , personally , I 've planned things so that that will be the end of me , " the 32-year-old national team captain was quoted as saying by the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday . 
Klinsmann said he believed Germany could win in France with the same nucleus of players which won the European championship in England this summer . 
" I think it can be done , " he said , " especially as experience is becoming more and more valuable in sport . 
I think we can do it with the same body of players . 
That 's what we 're all aiming for . " 
Coach Berti Vogts has called up a virtually identical squad for next week 's friendly against Poland -- Germany 's first match since Euro 96 .
