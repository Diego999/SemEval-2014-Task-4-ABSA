GOLF - HENKE TAKES LEAD IN MILWAUKEE , WOODS MAKES PRO DEBUT . 
MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-29 
Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut . 
Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade , Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik . 
Woods , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , almost eagled the 18th hole . 
He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace . 
" Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , " Woods said . " 
Today , I got to play golf . " 
He added : " I thought I got off off to a great start . 
It was a perfect start . 
I 'm in a good position . " 
Henke , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes . 
" We finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . " 
It was my best round in a very long time . 
My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often . 
That 's always been the worst part of my game . 
All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . " 
Henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career PGA Tour victories , but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic . 
Estes , whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place . 
" No bogeys on the card , " he noted . " 
Sometimes I take more pride in that . " 
Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart . 
Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back . 
Phil Mickelson , the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour , skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week . 
Mark Brooks , Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off .
