BONN 1996-08-31 
Iranian security forces burst into the home of a German cultural attache in Tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning , Bonn 's foreign ministry said on Saturday . 
A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel , which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives . 
Gust was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of " promoting activities hostile to the state " while his guests were taken away , the magazine said . 
The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government . 
The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and " disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law " , he added . 
Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident , which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding . 
All those detained appeared to have been freed , the spokesman said . 
Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr . 
Banisadr , an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . 
Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr , who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony . 
Banisadr , who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981 , told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct . 
If Germany were to extradite him , he said , it would " lose face before the whole world " . 
German prosecutors have already accused Iran 's intelligence minister Ali Fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the Kurdish leaders . 
Iran , which denies the allegations , urged German authorities to disregard Banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations .
