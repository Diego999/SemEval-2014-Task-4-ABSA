Escaped British paedophile recaptured . 
LONDON 1996-08-31 
A convicted British paedophile was arrested on Saturday , two days after escaping from custody during a supervised day trip to a zoo , police said . 
Trevor Holland , a 52 year-old with who has been convicted twice of gross indecency with children , was captured after being spotted in Worthing , a town on England 's southern coast . 
" A member of the public recognised Holland in a newsagent shop as he was reading the headlines about himself , " a police spokesman said . 
Police launched a nationwide search on Thursday after he disappeared during an unsupervised trip to the toilet while visiting a popular zoo and theme park south of London . 
Holland was moved to a more secure centre earlier this year after a similar incident . 
His escape at the zoo caused outrage in Britain . 
A child sex scandal in Belgium in which two eight-year-old girls were murdered and two other sexually abused girls were rescued has focused new attention on the problem .
