Dutch bond futures revival delayed - EOE . 
AMSTERDAM 1996-08-30 
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) said on Friday . 
Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system . 
" It 's not ready yet . 
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters . 
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks . 
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid . 
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .
