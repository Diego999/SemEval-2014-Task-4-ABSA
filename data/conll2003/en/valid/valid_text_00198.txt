JERUSALEM 1996-08-31 
A committee monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hizbollah guerrillas will meet in south Lebanon on Sunday to discuss an Israeli complaint against the Islamic group , the Israeli army said . 
Representatives of the five nations making up the committee -- Israel , Lebanon , Syria , France and the United States -- will meet at 11 a.m. ( 0800 GMT ) in Naqoura , the coastal headquarters of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) . 
" The committee will meet following a complaint by Israel over an incident in which two Lebanese residents were injured by Hizbollah fire in the Sikhin village ... 
on August 29 , " an Israeli army spokeswoman said on Saturday . 
The monitoring committee was set up to deal with violations of an April 25 ceasefire understanding that ended 17 days of fighting between Israel and the guerrillas . 
The understandings forbid firing from or at civilian targest but do not rule out guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops and their local militia allies in south Lebanon . 
Around 1,000 Israeli troops patrol a 15 km ( nine-mile ) south Lebanon occupation zone which the Jewish state carved out in 1985 to prevent attacks on its northern bordder . 
Hizbollah ( Party of God ) gunmen have waged a guerrilla war to oust Israel from the area .
