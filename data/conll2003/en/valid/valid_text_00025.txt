SOCCER - MILAN 'S LENTINI MOVES TO ATALANTA . 
MILAN 1996-08-30 
Former Italian international winger Gianluigi Lentini , transferred to Milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to serie A club Atalanta for a year , newspapers reported on Friday . 
The Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal would cost Atalanta around $ 600,000 . 
Lentini , 27 , joined Milan from Torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities . 
The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in Turin . 
The move to Bergamo-based Atalanta reunites Lentini , who fell out with ex-Milan coach Fabio Capello last season , with his former coach at Torino , Emiliano Mondonico .
