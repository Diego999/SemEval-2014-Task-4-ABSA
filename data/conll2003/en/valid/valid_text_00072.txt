France expels African , Air France unions protest . 
PARIS 1996-08-30 
France on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a Paris church as about 100 Air France workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home . 
A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said . 
He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said . 
Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention . 
About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants . 
" We must obtain a formal commitment from ( Air France chairman ) Christian Blanc that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said . 
He said civilians should not be police accomplices . 
Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain Juppe 's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets . 
The other two were military jets . 
Separately , Juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration . 
" Legislation is insufficient in several areas , notably in those concerning illegal work , " Juppe told reporters .
