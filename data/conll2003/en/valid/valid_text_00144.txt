GOLF - PARNEVIK TAKES ONE-SHOT LEAD AT GREATER MILWAUKEE OPEN . 
MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-31 
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open . 
Parnevik , who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament . 
Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft . 
Nolan Henke , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 . 
He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic . 
Tiger Woods , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament . 
The 20-year-old Woods , who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole . 
After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 . 
After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes . 
Parnevik continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes . 
" I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well , " said Parnevik . " 
I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in . 
" My game feels very good . 
I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight . 
Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . " 
Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole . 
" I did n't hit it very well today , " said Henke . " 
Jasper blew right by me . 
Once he did , I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up . 
I made some really good pars . 
I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon . 
" Right now , I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . " 
Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under . 
Steve Stricker , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under . 
Duffy Waldorf , who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including Kraft . 
The top four on the PGA Tour money list all skipped the tournament .
