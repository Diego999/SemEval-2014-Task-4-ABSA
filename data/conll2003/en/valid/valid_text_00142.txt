SQUASH - HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT . 
HONG KONG 1996-08-31 
Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday . 
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . 
When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : " You cheat . " 
" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , " said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . 
" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . " 
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision . 
The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 . 
" I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added . 
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end . 
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . " 
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . " 
What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors . 
" We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that . 
" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly . 
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . " 
Jansher , bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title , plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final . 
Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 . 
Eyles , who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game . 
" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him , " said Eyles . " 
My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration . 
I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together . "
