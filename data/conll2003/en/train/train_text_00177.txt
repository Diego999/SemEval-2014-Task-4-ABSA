SYDNEY 1996-08-23 
World number one golfer Greg Norman has sacked his coach Butch Harmon after a disappointing season . 
" Butch and I are finished , " Norman told reporters on Thursday before the start of the World Series of Golf in Akron , Ohio . 
Norman , a two-time British Open champion , parted ways with his long-time mentor after drawing a blank in this year 's four majors , winning two tournaments worldwide . 
The blonde Australian opened with a level par round of 70 in Akron , leaving him four shots adrift of the leaders , Americans Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos and Japan 's Hidemichi Tanaki . 
On Wednesday Norman described this year as his worst on the professional circuit since 1991 , when he failed to win a tournament . 
" My application this year has been strange , " Norman said . " 
Maybe I have n't been as keyed up as I should have been . " 
" Sometimes you do n't have it in your head to play . 
Maybe this was one of those years where I was there , but I was n't 100 percent there , and you have to be 100 percent to perform , " he said .
