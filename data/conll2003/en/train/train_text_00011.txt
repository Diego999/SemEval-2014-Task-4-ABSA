TUNIS 1996-08-22 
A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 100 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country . 
" This is not true . 
Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli , Tadeusz Awdankiewicz , told Reuters by telephone . 
Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate , but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries . 
He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya .
