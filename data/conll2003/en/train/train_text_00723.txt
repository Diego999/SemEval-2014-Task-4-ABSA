Romania 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in June to 1,242.9 billion lei for the January-June period from 596.5 billion lei in January-May , official data showed on Wednesday . 
Six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei , up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-May , with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent . 
January-June revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year . 
Romania 's government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit . 
Under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 566 billion lei . 
No new deficit forecast has been issued so far . 
In July the government gave a 6.0-percent wage and pension indexation to cover energy , fuel and bread price increases , which quickened inflation to 7.5 percent last month . 
In the original state budget , approved in March , revenues were envisaged at around 16.98 trillion lei and expenditures 20.17 trillion lei for 1996 . 
The state budget deficit was originally forecast to be 3.19 trillion lei for the whole year . 
On Wednesday , the leu 's official rate was 3,161 to the dollar .
