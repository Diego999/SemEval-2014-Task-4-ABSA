Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 1,000 metres . 
After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday , the Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the Brussels grand prix meeting . 
The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year . 
Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 . 
But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd . 
Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break . 
In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record . 
The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold . 
After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account . 
Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface . 
Masterkova clearly enjoyed it . 
Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .
