The Vnukovo Airlines Tupolev 154 flight from Moscow , carrying 129 passengers and a crew of 12 , crashed in bad weather 10 km ( six miles ) east of Longyearbyen , the island 's only airstrip , officials said . 
First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) and reported soon afterwards that most of the three-engine jet 's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside . 
Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight , scheduled to arrive at around 10.15 a.m. ( 0815 GMT ) , shortly before it was due to land . 
Spitzbergen is a Norwegian coal-mining settlement .
