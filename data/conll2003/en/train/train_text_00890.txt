RAMALLAH , West Bank 1996-08-29 
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti began talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank on Thursday on the stalled Middle East peace process , officials said . 
Kabariti flew by helicopter to Palestinian-ruled Ramallah and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with Arafat . 
The prime minister 's visit , his first trip outside the country since Jordan was shaken by food riots earlier this month , came against the backdrop of a Palestinian general strike in the West Bank and Gaza . 
Arafat called the four-hour strike , which ended at noon ( 0900 GMT ) to protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem . 
Jordan 's official state news agency Petra said Kabariti would hold discussions " on the latest developments in the peace process and bilateral cooperation " .
