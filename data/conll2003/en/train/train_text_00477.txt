Egypt to press Britain over Islamist conference . 
CAIRO 1996-08-26 
Egypt will tell Britain it is concerned about a meeting of Islamists to be held in London soon , Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Monday . 
" There is a question mark over this issue . 
We , and many other countries , do n't understand this ( Britain 's ) position , " Moussa told reporters . 
" Egypt will contact the British government to find out the truth of the matter and to discuss the possible consequences of such an unfortunate step , " he added . 
Egyptian government newspapers have criticised Britain for allowing Islamists , whom they brand as " terrorists " , to hold their conference , saying the meeting will be a chance for dangerous Moslem militants to plot against their countries of origin . 
It is not clear when the conference will be held . 
About 1,000 people have been killed in Egypt since Islamic militants took up arms in 1992 in an attempt to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state . 
Cairo says several Egyptian militants on the run from death sentences or convictions for violent attacks at home have taken shelter in Britain .
