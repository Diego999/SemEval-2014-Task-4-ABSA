Canada 's Prairies saw no frost on Monday morning and none was expected anywhere on the grainbelt until late in the Labour Day long weekend , Environment Canada said . 
" Apparently , we 're home free for the rest of the week . 
We 're not calling for any frost until after the weekend when it starts to cool off in northwestern Alberta after the weekend probably Monday or Tuesday , " meteorologist Gerald Machnee told Reuters . 
Sprague , Manitoba , on the Minnesota border was the cold spot of the Prairies Monday morning at 4.0 Celsius ( 39.2 F ) . 
Temperatures at ground level can be 2.0 to 5.0 Celsius lower than at chest level depending on windspeed , sky conditions and ground surface moisture . 
Freezing occurs at 0 Celsius ( 32.0 F ) . 
North Battleford , Sask . 
, reported a low of 5.0 Celsius ( 41.0 F ) and Grande Prairie , Alta .

Machnee dismissed talk of frost Wednesday by proponents of the " full moon , frost soon " school of thought .
