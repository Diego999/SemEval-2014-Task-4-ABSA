Malawi 's ex-president Banda says he 's feeling well . 
BLANTYRE 1996-08-24 
Malawi 's frail former president , Kamuzu Banda , said on Saturday in a rare public interview that he was feeling well despite his advanced years . 
" I feel all right and I eat everything that is put on the table . 
And that means I am all right , " he told reporters invited to his home . 
Banda , a vegetarian teetotaller believed to be 97 , walked unaided but supporting himself on a walking stick . 
He clutched a fly whisk which for a long time symbolised his obsession with power . 
His health was the subject of much recent speculation . 
Malawi 's undisputed ruler for three decades , he lost power in the first all-party elections in 1994 . 
He spent a year under house arrest and was tried but acquitted last year on charges of ordering the murder of four opponents in 1983 .
