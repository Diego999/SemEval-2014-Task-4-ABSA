Indonesia plays down U.S. consulate attack . 
JAKARTA 1996-08-29 
Indonesia sought on Thursday to play down a fire bomb attack on a U.S. consulate earlier this week , saying it was being treated as a criminal rather than a political act , the official Antara news agency said . 
The police are still investigating the incident . 
It is evident the happening is not politically motivated but just an ordinary criminal act , the news agency quoted East Java military commander Major-General Utomo as saying . 
The Tuesday morning attack on the consulate in Indonesias second largest city of Surabaya , caused slight damage to a guard house before being quickly extinguished , a spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Jakarta , 700 km ( 430 miles ) west of Surabaya , said on Wednesday . 
No one was injures , he said . 
Nobody should try and exaggerate it by calling it a bomb because it was just a molotov cocktail , Utomo said . 
He said police were investigating the incident and patrols around diplomatic offices in Surabaya would be stepped up .
