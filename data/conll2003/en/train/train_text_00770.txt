Stephanie of Monaco 's husband snapped cavorting . 
ROME 1996-08-28 
Two Italian magazines published pictures on Wednesday of Daniel Ducruet , Princess Stephanie of Monaco 's husband and former bodyguard , cavorting naked with another woman by a poolside in France . 
The magazines , Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente , printed up to 26 pages of photos of the woman undressing Ducruet , the pair embracing on a sunbed and finally both naked . 
Eva Tremila said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them . 
The magazines named the woman as Fili Houteman , a 26-year-old French singer and dancer in a Belgian cabaret club . 
The photographs , an Italian exclusive , raised eyebrows in the tiny principality , where Stephanie 's father Prince Rainier , had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband . 
Stephanie had two children with Ducruet before their marriage in July last year . 
Stephanie , Caroline and Albert are the children of Rainier and former Hollywood screen goddess Grace Kelly , who was killed in a car crash in 1982 . 
" We have seen the photos but for the moment the palace has no comment , " a spokeswoman for Prince Rainier told Reuters . 
The magazines said the photographs were taken in Cap de Villefranche , some 15 km ( nine miles ) from Monte Carlo . 
Gente said Ducruet , a keen racing driver , met Houteman during a race in Belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since . 
The magazine said video cameras had also been used to film the couple and that a sound-track existed .
