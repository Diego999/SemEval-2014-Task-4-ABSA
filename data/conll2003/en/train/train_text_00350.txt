Rafael Palmeiro 's two-out single in the sixth inning scored Roberto Alomar with the go-ahead run as the Baltimore Orioles rallied past the California Angels 5-4 and took over the American League 's wild-card berth on Saturday .

After Brady Anderson sacrificed , Palmeiro hit the first pitch into right field for a single , scoring Alomar . 
In Boston , former Mariner Darren Bragg 's first career grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Randy Johnson lifted the Boston Red Sox to their fifth win in six games , a 9-5 victory over Seattle . 
" Just one of those things , I was just trying to make contact , " said Bragg . " 
The bases were loaded and I had two strikes . 
I was just trying to put the ball in play . 
I got the good part of the bat on it and it carried out . " 
In Cleveland , Kevin Seitzer 's two-out single in the top of the 10th brought home David Hulse with the winning run as the Milwaukee Brewers sent the Cleveland Indians to their third straight extra-inning defeat 4-3 .

Every game should be important , but it 's a little more important now . "
