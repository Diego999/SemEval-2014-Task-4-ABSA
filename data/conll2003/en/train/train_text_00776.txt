The New Zealand money market gained slightly at Wednesday 's close after what dealers described as a see-saw trading session . 
Ninety-day bank bill rates shed five points to 9.93 percent and September bank bill futures rose four to 90.18 . 
However , bonds finished largely flat . 
" Our bonds were better bid initially but they sold off on a lack of demand , and the short end went with it too on a lower currency . 
" There were big buyers at the base of where the market sold to , and when the currency got bought back on talk of a samurai the market got bought back again , " a dealer said . 
Volumes were reasonable in the money market but thin in bonds . 
Dealers said the market seemed to be trading a range and would wait for more political polls to provide direction . 
They were confident of further eurokiwi issuance but said the timing was less of a certainty .
