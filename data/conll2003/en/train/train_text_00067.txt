Measles exposure can lead to bowel disease - study . 
LONDON 1996-08-23 
Women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of Crohn 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on Friday . 
Three out of four Swedish babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of Crohn 's disease , the researchers said . 
Dr Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine and colleagues screened 25,000 babies delivered at University Hospital , Uppsala , between 1940 and 1949 . 
Four of the mothers had measles while pregnant . 
" Three of the four children had Crohn 's disease , " Wakefield 's group wrote in the Lancet medical journal . 
Crohn 's is an inflammation of the bowel that can sometimes require surgery . 
It causes diarrhoea , abdominal pain and weight loss . 
The researchers said the three children involved had especially severe cases . 
Exposure to viruses can often cause birth defects . 
Most notably , women who get rubella ( German measles ) have a high risk of a stillborn baby .
