It was a bush that bagged the bad guys . 
When four would-be robbers , armed and masked , showed up to rob a Checker 's restaurant in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Pembroke Pines on Tuesday , they had no idea the shrub near the drive-through window was toting a shotgun . 
Detective Earl Feugill , camouflaged as a shaggy green bush , ordered them to freeze . " 
They were quite surprised , " he told the Miami Herald . 
Feugill said he made the hot , heavy suit , which he first used in the Marines , by attaching strips of burlap to a camouflage outfit . 
Green and black face paint completed his disguise . 
He was staking out the restaurant after a series of robberies at local fast-food places . 
Pembroke Pines police said five people were arrested as a result of the 90-minute stakeout , including the four robbers and a restaurant employee who was allegedly prepared to let them in a back door .
