RABOBANK [ RABN.CN ] SEES H2 NET GROWTH UNDER 10 PCT . 
AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26 
Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank Nederland BA 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 , executive board chairman Herman Wijffels said on Monday . 
The unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders , up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 . 
He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income . 
" We expect reasonable growth in the second half . 
Maybe it will be in single-digits , " Wijffels told Reuters . 
He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace . 
Rabobank 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 . 
The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment . 
But Wijffels was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services .
