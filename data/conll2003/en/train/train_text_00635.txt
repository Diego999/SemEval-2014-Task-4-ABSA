Passengers injured in train collision in Linz . 
LINZ , Austria 1996-08-28 
A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured . 
Austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in Linz , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of Vienna . 
" One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in Linz told Reuters by telephone . 
The express passenger train travelling from Steyr , southeast of Linz , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings . 
The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage . 
Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added . 
Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA .
