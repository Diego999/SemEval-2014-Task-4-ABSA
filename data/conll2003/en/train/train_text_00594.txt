Paralympics an example for gloomy France-Juppe . 
PARIS 1996-08-27 
Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Tuesday hailed handicapped athletes who took part in Atlanta 's Paralympic Games as an example for gloom-stricken France . 
" What we hear every morning is gloom , resignation and scepticism ... 
You are the opposite , " Juppe told a successful French team at Paris airport as he welcomed them back from the games which followed the July-August Olympics . 
" If you had been struck ... 
by the disease of scepticism , gloom and resignation , you would not be here . 
You are a true example for the nation , " he said . 
The French team won 95 medals in Atlanta , 35 of them gold . 
Opinion polls consistently show French voters pessimistic and fed up as the economy stagnates and unemployement lingers at near-record levels .
