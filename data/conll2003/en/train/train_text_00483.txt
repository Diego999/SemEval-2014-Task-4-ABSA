U.S. Midwest hog market seen steady Tuesday - trade . 
CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said . 
The demand was sparked by Saturday 's active slaughter , which left some packers short on supplies to get Monday operations started , they said . 
Top prices in Iowa / southern Minnesota Tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 , steady following a $ 0.50 - $ 1.50 jump Monday . 
Illinois tops were seen matching Monday 's at $ 59.00 with tops in Indiana at $ 57.50 . 
However , USDA reported tops of $ 58.00 in Illinois and in Iowa / southern Minnesota , $ 60.00 on some hogs Monday . 
Attempts to move prices higher again Tuesday could be offset by expected increased hog marketings this week , sources said . 
Producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend , they said . 
Demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week , as the industry prepares for Labor Day , Monday , September 1 when most U.S. packers will be closed .
