At least 50 Russian servicemen have been killed in a battle with separatist rebels which erupted in the Chechen capital Grozny on Thursday and continued after Russia and the rebels agreed a truce , Interfax news agency said . 
Interfax quoted Russian military command in Chechnya as saying that about 200 interior ministry forces , sent on reconaisance mission , clashed with rebels at Minutka Square . 
The Interfax report could not be independently confirmed . 
Moscow peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov signed an agreement earlier on Thursday under which the two sides would cease all hostilities at noon ( 0800 GMT ) on Friday . 
Interfax made clear that the interior ministry detachment had been sent on the mission before the truce deal had been signed at the local equivalent of 1500 GMT . 
But fierce fighting still raged at 1600 GMT , Interfax said . 
It quoted a source in the Russian command in Chechnya as saying that the servicemen were outnumbered by the rebels .
