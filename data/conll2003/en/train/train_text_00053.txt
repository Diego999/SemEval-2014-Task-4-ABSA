With one out , Greer hit a 1-1 pitch from Julian Tavarez ( 4-7 ) over the right-field fence for his 15th home run . 
" It was an off-speed pitch and I just tried to get a good swing on it and put it in play , " Greer said . " 
This was a big game . 
The crowd was behind him and it was intense . " 
The shot brought home Ivan Rodriguez , who had his second double of the game , giving him 42 this season , 41 as a catcher .
