FRANKFURT 1996-08-22 
German first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period , the Federal office for motor vehicles said on Thursday . 
The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks . 
The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995 . 
Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period . 
The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said . 
Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period . 
Volkswagen AG won 77,719 registrations , slightly more than a quarter of the total . 
Opel AG together with General Motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations , 16.4 percent of the overall figure . 
Third was Ford with 35,563 registrations , or 11.7 percent .
