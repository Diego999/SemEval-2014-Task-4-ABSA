RTRS - Guinness Peat expects strong full yr . 
SYDNEY 1996-08-28 
British-based investment company Guinness Peat Group Plc ( GPG ) said on Wednesday it expected a strong full year result . 
" We think we 're in a position to produce a strong result , however a lot of our profitability must inevitably depend on a number of ( company ) results , " said GPG director Garry Weiss . 
GPG earlier said its net profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 9.77 million pounds from 6.93 million in the previous first half . 
The company did not declare an interim dividend as in the previous year . 
Weiss said the Australian share market had been somewhat negative for much of 1996 and this had some effect on the company 's first half results . 
" However , it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months , " he said . 
Weiss said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 50 percent stake in Physicians Insurance Co of Ohio . 
He said the company decided to sell its U.S. investment in order to consolidate investments closer to its administrative base . 
GPG said its stakes in Tyndall Australia Ltd and Mid-East Minerals Ltd both contributed strongly to GPG 's first half earnings .
