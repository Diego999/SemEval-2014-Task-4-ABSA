Oasis singer heads for U.S. after illness . 
LONDON 1996-08-29 
Liam Gallagher , singer of Britain 's top rock group Oasis , flew out on Thursday to join the band three days after the start of its U.S. tour . 
Gallagher made his usual obscene gestures and swore at journalists as he prepared to fly from London 's Heathrow airport to Chicago . 
" I hate you f... ing lot , yet you 're always asking me too many things . 
I 'm not a supermodel you know , " he said . 
On Monday , just 15 minutes before his flight was due to depart , Liam decided not to travel with the rest of the group , which includes his brother Noel . 
Liam caught a taxi back to London saying he had " problems at home " . 
He was believed to be suffering from laryngitis and said he had to go house-hunting with actress girlfriend Patsy Kensit . 
When they first heard that Liam had not flown out with the band at the start of the tour , many U.S. fans asked for refunds on their concert tickets . 
The group began the U.S. tour , which is scheduled to last until September 18 , with a concert in Chicago on Tuesday at which Noel Gallagher filled in for his brother as lead singer .
