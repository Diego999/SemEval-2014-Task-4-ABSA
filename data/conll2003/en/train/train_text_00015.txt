" The meeting between Peres and Arafat will take place at Erez checkpoint in Gaza and not in Ramallah as planned , " Peres ' office said . 
Palestinian officials said the Israeli government had barred Arafat from overflying Israel in a Palestinian helicopter to the West Bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with Peres .
