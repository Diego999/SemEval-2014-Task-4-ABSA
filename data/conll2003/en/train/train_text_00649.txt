ROWING - REDGRAVE MAY SEEK FIFTH OLYMPIC GOLD . 
LONDON 1996-08-28 
Britain 's Steven Redgrave said on Wednesday he might change his mind and go for a fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Games in Sydney . 
Redgrave is one of only five athletes who have won gold medals at four successive Olympics . 
He shared victory with Matthew Pinsent in the coxless pairs at the Atlanta Games and said at the time that would be his last shot . 
But he has had second thoughts since then . " 
I 'm only 34 . 
Some say that 's too old for an athlete , " he said . 
" But I 'll be 38 by Sydney and that 's not too old . 
It 's whether I have got the enthusiasm for the training over the next four years . 
Rowing is an endurance sport . "
