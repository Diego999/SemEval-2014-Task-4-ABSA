Lamm will not endorse Perot for Reform ticket-CNN . 
WASHINGTON 1996-08-27 
Former Colorado Democratic Gov . 
Richard Lamm has decided not to endorse Ross Perot as the presidential candidate of the Reform Party , CNN reported late Tuesday . 
CNN quoted aides and family members as saying Lamm , who competed with Perot to head the ticket for Perot 's party , had told them he would definitely not endorse Perot , but they did not know whether he would endorse another candidate . 
An announcement was planned in Chicago Wednesday . 
Lamm , 60 , is a three-term Colorado governor who left office in 1987 and vied for the Reform Party nomination after becoming disillusioned with both the Democratic and Republican parties . 
Lamm is a friend of President Clinton and supported him in the 1992 election . 
Perot won his party 's official nomination as its presidential candidate in a secret ballot earlier this month .
