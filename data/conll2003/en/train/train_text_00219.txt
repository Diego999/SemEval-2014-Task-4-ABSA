Analysts hold Dutch PTT estimates . 
AMSTERDAM 1996-08-23 
Dutch post and telecoms group Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV 's ( Dutch PTT ) first half results came marginally below most analysts ' forecasts , giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates , analysts said on Friday . 
PTT earlier announced an 8.5 percent rise in net profit for the first six months of 1996 to 1.209 billion guilders , a hair 's breadth below the 1.210-1.236 billion forecast range . 
" They were pretty much in line with our estimate of 1.210 billion , " said Peter Roe , at Paribas in London . " 
As we expected volume growth was quite good ... 
there 's really no reason to change our forecast and our largely positive view on the stock . " 
" Coming just a million guilders under the forecast range is n't overwhelmingly surprising , " said ING analyst Steven Vrolijk , who is continuing to look for a nine to 10 percent rise in 1996 earnings . 
" They 've got a very sound domestic business which is doing very well , we remain positive on the stock , " said Roe . " 
We think it 's a solid performer in the Dutch market . " 
Roe said he was sticking by his forecast of a 2.45 billion guilder net for 1996 . 
Dutch PTT earlier on Friday repeated a forecast it would improve on 1995 's 2.26 billion guilder net profit for the whole year of 1996 . 
By 1403 GMT the shares were down 1.70 guilders to 61.00 guilders , falling in a weaker Amsterdam bourse .
