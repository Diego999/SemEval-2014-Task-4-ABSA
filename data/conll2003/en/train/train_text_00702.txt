Rugby union-England given final chance to stay in Five Nations . 
LONDON 1996-08-28 
England have been given a final chance to remain in the Five Nations ' championship despite striking an exclusive television deal with Rupert Murdoch 's Sky television . 
In a statement on Wednesday , the Four Nations TV Committee said dates had been set for a competition involving Scotland , Wales , Ireland and France next year . 
" Between now and then , discussions will take place in one final attempt to persuade the Rugby Football Union to save the Five Nations ' championship in its current form , " the statement said . 
No further details were immediately available . 
England infuriated their championship colleagues when they decided to sign a 87.5 million pounds sterling ( $ 135.8 million ) deal giving Sky television exclusive rights to rugby union matches in England . 
The present contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation was shared between the four home nations while France have their own television deal . 
Last month Five Nations ' committee chairman Tom Kiernan said England would be thrown out of the competition " unless circumstances change in the near future " .
