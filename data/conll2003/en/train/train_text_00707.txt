He is being asked for the source of his information and who gave him this confidential document , " one colleague told Reuters . 
Three journalists from the Ivorian opposition daily La Voie are serving two-year prison terms for insulting President Henri Konan Bedie . 
A court sentenced two in December and the third in January . 
La Voie published an article suggesting the presence of Bedie had brought local team ASEC bad luck during their defeat by Orlando Pirates of South Africa in the final of the African Champions Cup in December . 
The United States embassy in Abidjan and international press organisations denounced the sentences as excessive . 
Last year , Bedie pardoned four journalists jailed for the same or similar offences . 
They included one of the three La Voie journalists . 
Bedie pardoned two other journalists jailed for incitement to disturb public order .
