Arch Alberta well tests 1,100 bbl / day . 
FORT WORTH , Texas 1996-08-28 
Arch Petroleum Inc said Wednesday an exploratory well in Alberta 's Morinville area tested in excess of 1,100 barrels daily and will begin production immediately . 
The company said the 90 percent owned Trax et al Morinville 10-23 logged 28 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,350 feet . 
Reserve estimates from this well are at 250,000 gross barrels of oil . 
The Trax well is one of the prospects developed by Arch through its early 1996 purchase of Trax Petroleums Ltd , the company said . 
It said another , the Cometra et al Morinville 11-13 , has logged 128 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,400 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 590 barrels of oil per day on a 15 / 64ths-inch choke . 
Arch owns a 16 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator . 
Arch said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil . 
A third well drilled in this area , the Trax et al Morinville 2-25 , encountered the Leduc Reef but tested wet . 
At the company 's Nordegg prospect , the Apache et al Saunders 14-28 , has reached total depth in the Leduc Reef at approximately 3,800 feet and has been abandoned , Arch said . 
It said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 5,120 acres , building the company 's gross land position in this area to 8,320 acres . 
At the Butte prospect , the Garrington 4-8 has reached total depth of 11,500 and has logged 278 feet of Leduc Reef . 
Testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days , Arch said . 
Including the costs of the two abandoned wells , the company said , these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about U.S. $ 2 per barrel of oil equivalent .
