South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers .

South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . 
Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . 
Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . 
But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating . 
Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . 
" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . " 
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . " 
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . 
But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify . 
Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . 
He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called . 
But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . 
" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . 
At the moment this is not the case . " 
He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . 
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . 
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . 
Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied . 
Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : 
" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . 
What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . " 
Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission . 
" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . 
One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said . 
Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying : 
" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy . 
Responsibility is percolating downwards . "
