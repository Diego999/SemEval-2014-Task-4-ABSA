Egypt wants nothing to do with Sudanese rulers . 
CAIRO 1996-08-22 
The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday . 
Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year . 
It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident . 
The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men , but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan . 
" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever , " Mubarak told a group of academics . 
Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government . 
" I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter . 
There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said . 
He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .
