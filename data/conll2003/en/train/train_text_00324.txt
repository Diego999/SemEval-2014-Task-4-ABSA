CRICKET - POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH . 
LONDON 1996-08-25 
South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire . 
Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 . 
After an hour 's interruption for rain , Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games . 
Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey . 
Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire . 
Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours . 
Yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 7.5 overs to spare .
