JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-28 
Western Province batsman Herschelle Gibbs was the only uncapped player in South Africa 's 14-man squad named on Wednesday for a quadrangular one-day series in Kenya next month . 
Kenya , South Africa , Pakistan and Sri Lanka will take part in the series . 
National coach Bob Woolmer said Gibbs , 22 , had been rewarded for a tremendous tour of England with the South African A team earlier this year . 
" I 've known Herschelle since he was 11 years old and he showed in England how he has matured . 
His 170 against the MCC was an innings of supreme class against the best bowling attack we faced all tour , " Woolmer told a news conference . 
. 
" We were not able to consider Jacques Kallis , Paul Adams and Shaun Pollock due to injury and the replacements have all come from the A tour and it 's great that they are all in form . " 
Spin-bowling all-rounders Nicky Boje and Derek Crookes replace Pollock and Adams , while Gibbs comes in for his Western Province colleague Kallis . 
Squad : Hansie Cronje ( captain ) , Craig Matthews ( vice-captain ) , Dave Richardson , Brian McMillan , Gary Kirsten , Andrew Hudson , Pat Symcox , Jonty Rhodes , Allan Donald , Fanie de Villiers , Daryll Cullinan , Derek Crookes , Herschelle Gibs , Nicky Boje .
