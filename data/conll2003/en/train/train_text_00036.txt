LONDON 1996-08-22 
Kenny Dalglish spoke on Thursday of his sadness at leaving Blackburn , the club he led to the English premier league title in 1994-95 . 
Blackburn announced on Wednesday they and Dalglish had parted by mutual consent . 
But the ex-manager confessed on Thursday to being " sad " at leaving after taking Blackburn from the second division to the premier league title inside three and a half years . 
In a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in Spain , Dalglish said : " We came to the same opinion , albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me . " 
He added : " If no one asked , I never opened my mouth . 
I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job . 
The club thought it ( the job ) had run its course and I came to the same conclusion . " 
Dalglish had been with Blackburn for nearly five years , first as manager and then , for the past 15 months , as director of football .
