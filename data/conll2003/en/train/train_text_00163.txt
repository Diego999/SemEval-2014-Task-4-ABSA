BONN 1996-08-23 
Trainer Berti Vogts kept faith with his entire European championship winning squad for Germany 's first match since their title victory , a friendly in Poland . 
Vogts picked no new players for the squad for the September 4 game in Zabrze . 
Instead on Friday he nominated all 23 Euro ' 96 veterans including Bremen 's Jens Todt , called up before the final by special UEFA dispensation . 
He will , however , have to do without the Dortmund trio of libero Matthias Sammer , midfielder Steffen Freund and defender Rene Schneider , who were all formally nominated despite being injured . 
" This squad is currently the basis of my planning for the 1998 World Cup , " Vogts said . " 
We 'll have to see which other players produce good league performances to play themselves into the squad . " 
Squad : 
Goalkeepers - Oliver Kahn , Andreas Koepke , Oliver Reck 
Defenders - Markus Babbel , Thomas Helmer , Juergen Kohler , Stefan Reuter , Matthias Sammer , Rene Schneider 
Midfielders - Mario Basler , Marco Bode , Dieter Eilts , Steffen Freund , Thomas Haessler , Andreas Moeller , Mehmet Scholl , Thomas Strunz , Jens Todt , Christian Ziege
