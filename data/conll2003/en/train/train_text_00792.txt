Mohammad Dahman , director of the Gaza-based Addameer Prisoners Support Association , said he was freed on Tuesday without being charged . 
Palestinian Attorney-General Khaled al-Qidra was not immediately available to comment . 
Qidra had said Dahman was arrested on suspicion of making a false statement . 
The activist was detained by Palestinian intelligence service agents on August 12 after publishing a statement demanding an investigation into the death of a Gaza man who had been questioned by Palestinian authorities . 
The Palestinian Authority said the dead man , Nahed Dahlan , had committed suicide . 
Human rights groups had protested about Dahman 's arrest in letters to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and to Qidra .
