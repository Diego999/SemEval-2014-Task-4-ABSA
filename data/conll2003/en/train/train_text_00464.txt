MANAGUA , Nicaragua 1996-08-26 
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro underwent successful surgery in the United States on Monday to correct a compression in her lower spinal column , the government said . 
Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore found an inflamation in her spinal column that , once treated , will free her of chronic pain in her back and one leg that has limited her movement , a government statement said . 
" ( Chamorro ) is in good health and , according to her doctors , will be able to return to Nicaragua next week , " it said . 
Chamorro , 66 , had complained of lower back pain since a trip to Taiwan in May , when pain forced her to go to Taipei University Hospital for an examination . 
She suffers from osteoporosis , a disease that weakens the bones , and has repeatedly flown to Washington for treatment . 
She is scheduled to step down in January after a term of nearly seven years .
