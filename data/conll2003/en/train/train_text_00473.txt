JAKARTA 1996-08-26 
The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in quiet trading on Monday , dealers said . 
They said volume was thin following a public holiday in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom . 
" We did n't see anything from Singapore operators either . 
It 's a pretty quiet day , " one foreign bank dealer said . 
Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0 / 42.5 at 0915 GMT , unchanged from the opening level . 
It was softer in the morning due to relatively ample rupiah liquidity but recovered later . 
Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,342.00 / 42.45 and 2,341.5 / 42.0 , respectively . 
Another dealer said operators were reluctant to unload rupiah despite ample conditions due to the month-end factor . 
" There are two factors which determine the market at present . 
The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday , " the dealer said . 
Megawati Sukarnoputri , deposed leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) has sued the government for ousting her as PDI leader . 
The central Jakarta court adjourned the case last Thursday for possible out-of-court settlement . 
The hearing is due to resume on Thursday . 
Megawati 's lawyers said they were still discussing a possible out of court settlement but they was not optimistic an agreement could be reached . 
The dealer said this issue remained a factor but its importance to the market seemed to diminish . 
He said liquidity would be the main concern for the next few days . 
Overnight swap was at 0.45 / 0.48 and tom / next at 0.50 / 0.55 . 
One-month swap was at 18.0 / 18.5 , two at 34.0 / 35.0 , three at 52.75 / 53.50 and six at 106.5 / 107.0 points .
