Mother Teresa spent her 86th birthday in a Calcutta hospital bed on Tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world . 
Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days . 
" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , " an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . " 
She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . " 
The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting . 
She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria . 
Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said . 
" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , " said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa . 
The nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world . 
Pope John Paul II and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy sent her get-well messages , the Press Trust of India said . 
" Ask for a miracle . 
Happy Birthday to our Dearest Mother , " read a placard at the Shishu Bhavan children 's home in central Calcutta run by Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity . 
On Monday , both houses of India 's parliament wished the nation 's adopted sister a happy birthday and speedy recovery from her illness . 
Prayers continued in Calcutta , one of the world 's poorest cities , where Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity runs several homes for the poor and destitute . 
Street children , some of them born to prostitutes , held prayers on the street . " 
All of us know about her . 
She is like a goddess , " said Raju , 8 , who has a mother but no father . 
The Statesman newspaper quoted 40-year-old Mangala Das , paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the Prem Dan ( Gift of Love ) home for the destitute , as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for Mother Teresa 's recovery . 
Tarak Das , 70 , was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal Hriday ( Immaculate Home ) . 
" I do not know who she is . 
I have never seen her , but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me , " Das told The Statesman . 
Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated , and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns . 
Thousands in Calcutta , where she founded her Missionaries of Charity religious order in 1949 , prayed for her recovery . 
Ministers of the communist government of West Bengal state and people of different religions joined Catholics to pray for Mother Teresa 's recovery at Mother House . 
" We joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , " said Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya , a communist minister in West Bengal .
