GOLF - PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR OLAZABAL . 
NORTHAMPTON , England 1996-08-27 
Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course . 
The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux , France from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy . 
" If the ( Tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain . 
But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . " 
I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . " 
You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . " 
The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup .
