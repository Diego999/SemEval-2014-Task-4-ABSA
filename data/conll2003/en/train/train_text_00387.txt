Netanyahu , Weizman consult on Arafat invitation . 
JERUSALEM 1996-08-25 
Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said . 
Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said . 
Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process . 
But the official , Aryeh Shumer , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces . 
The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president . 
After Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended . 
Shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue .
