Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year . 
Tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart , and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly . 
Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year . 
Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday . 
" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch . 
" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , " he said . 
He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was " rock solid " . 
Its link to the U.S. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years . 
" There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change . 
A lot of investment in Hong Kong , some of which ( is ) by China , is predicated on the link continuing . " 
Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . 
Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong 's 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . " 
None of our basic precepts have been challenged . " 
Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves . 
It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing , Tsang said . 
He described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " . 
" You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years . 
Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . " 
Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce . 
The government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems . 
" There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market . 
Tsang , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under British rule and three years under China .
