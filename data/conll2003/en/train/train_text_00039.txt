Everton 's Duncan Ferguson , who scored twice against Manchester United on Wednesday , was picked on Thursday for the Scottish squad after a 20-month exile . 
Glasgow Rangers striker Ally McCoist , another man in form after two hat-tricks in four days , was also named for the August 31 World Cup qualifier against Austria in Vienna . 
Ferguson , who served six weeks in jail in late 1995 for head-butting an opponent , won the last of his five Scotland caps in December 1994 . 
Scotland manager Craig Brown said on Thursday : " I 've watched Duncan Ferguson in action twice recently and he 's bang in form . 
Ally McCoist is also in great scoring form at the moment . " 
Celtic 's Jackie McNamara , who did well with last season 's successful under-21 team , earns a call-up to the senior squad .
