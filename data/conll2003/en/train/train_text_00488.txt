LONDON 1996-08-26 
NWE oil products were mixed on Monday but markets were becalmed because of a public holiday in the United Kingdom , traders said . 
An explosion at Repsol 's Puertollano refinery , which killed four workers , had not affected output of oil products , an official said . 
" The plant is functioning as usual , " Jose Manuel Prieto , director of personnel , told Spanish state television . 
Gasoline prices were notionally unchanged from Friday despite sagging NYMEX numbers , with the arbitrage window to the U.S. considered closed for the moment . 
Eurograde barges were offered at $ 207 fob ARA for Amsterdam-Rotterdam barrels , and at $ 206 for full ARA material . 
" There is no market at the moment , " one Rotterdam trader said . " 
Maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . " 
Outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) had issued a tender to buy only 120,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for October . 
Asian traders had earlier expected an IOC tender for around 400,000 tonnes . 
ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while Antwerp material was available for 0-50 cents over September . 
The IOC tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one German player said . 
Fuel oil markets were also listless . 
Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 102 fob ARA but bids were scarce .
