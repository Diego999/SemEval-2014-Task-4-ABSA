Baltimore Orioles manager Davey Johnson will miss Thursday night 's game against the Seattle Mariners after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat . 
The 53-year-old Johnson was hospitalized after experiencing dizziness . 
" He is in no danger and will be treated and observed this evening , " said Orioles team physician Dr. William Goldiner , adding that Johnson is expected to be released on Friday . 
Orioles ' bench coach Andy Etchebarren will manage the club in Johnson 's absence . 
Johnson is the second manager to be hospitalized this week after California Angels skipper John McNamara was admitted to New York 's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday with a blood clot in his left calf . 
Johnson , who played eight seasons in Baltimore , was named Orioles manager in the off-season replacing Phil Regan . 
He led the Cincinnati Reds to the National League Championship Series last year and guided the New York Mets to a World Series championship in 1986 . 
Baltimore has won 16 of its last 22 games to pull within five games of the slumping New York Yankees in the American League East Division .
