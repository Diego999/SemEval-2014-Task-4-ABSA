CANBERRA 1996-08-22 
The Australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said in its annual report . 
" The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the RBA said . 
The bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth , but evidence was ambiguous . 
In its 1996/97 budget announced on Tuesday , the Australian Coalition government announced an underlying budget deficit of A$ 5.65 billion , and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 1998/99 . 
The budget deficit was A$ 10.3 billion in 1995/96 .

" Determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions ( are ) often rewarded by rising confidence , giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term , " it said . 
" More generally , the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive , with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates , " the RBA said .
