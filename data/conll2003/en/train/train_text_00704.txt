The African Football Confederation ( CAF ) on Wednesday formally confirmed Burundi 's disqualification from the African Nations Cup following the team 's inability to travel for a qualifier against Central African Republic . 
The Burundi team were unable to leave their troubled country for a preliminary round first leg match in Bangui earlier this month because of an air ban imposed in a recent set of internationally-sponsored sanctions .

" After examining the dossier of the Burundi-Central Africa match , we decided ... 
to disqualify the national team of Burundi from the 21st African Cup of Nations ...
