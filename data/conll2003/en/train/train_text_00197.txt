BOSTON 1996-08-23 
The 12-year-old daughter of Republican Gov . 
William Weld is working to stop his bid to win a U.S. Senate seat because she does n't want to leave Massachusetts . 
Weld conceded his 12-year-old daughter , Franny , is " a foot soldier " for Democratic incumbent Sen . 
John Kerry , even though she is n't old enough to vote . 
Weld , speaking on WBUR-FM radio on Thursday , said he was facing a revolt from his daughter in part because she does not want to leave Cambridge , Massachusetts , and move to Washington . 
He also said Franny Weld 's best friend , Tracy Roosevelt , might have something to do with her politics . 
Tracy is the great-granddaughter of Democratic former President Franklin Roosevelt , and support for Democrats runs in the family . 
The Roosevelts are good friends of Weld and his wife , Susan Roosevelt Weld , a descendant of former President Theodore Roosevelt , who won the presidency as a Republican .
