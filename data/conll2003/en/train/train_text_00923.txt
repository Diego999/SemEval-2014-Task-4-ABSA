SINGAPORE 1996-08-29 
Simex Nikkei futures ended easier but off the day 's lows on Thursday . 
Dealers said selling in the session was a follow-through from Wednesday 's gloomy Tankan corporate report by the Bank of Japan . 
" The Nikkei is testing support at the 20,500 level . 
Sentiment is a bit gloomy because people are focusing on the weak recovery in the economy at the moment , " said a dealer with a European bank . 
September Nikkei settled at 20,605 after touching an intraday low of 20,530 against its previous close of 20,725 . 
Volume was 19,560 contracts . 
Dealers said technically , the index should see good support at 20,300 and the upside should be capped at 21,000 .
