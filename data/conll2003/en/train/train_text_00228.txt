SEOUL 1996-08-23 
Students at South Korea 's Yonsei University threw more than just ordinary rocks at riot police -- some were samples that the geology department had taken 30 years to collect , newspapers reported on Friday . 
Geology prefessors were quoted as saying that their collection of 10,000 rocks , gathered from across the nation and abroad , were irreplaceable . 
" These are not like missing window panes or broken desks . 
They are lost forever , " said one professor . 
The students staged a violent nine-day demonstration at the university to demand unification with North Korea . 
Police ended the protest on Tuesday after storming the campus .
