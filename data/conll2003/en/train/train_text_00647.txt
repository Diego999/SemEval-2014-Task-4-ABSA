SOCCER - FOWLER AND MCMANAMAN OUT OF ENGLAND SQUAD . 
LONDON 1996-08-28 
England soccer manager Glen Hoddle confirmed on Wednesday that the Liverpool pair of Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler would miss England 's World Cup qualifying match against Moldova on Sunday . 
The two men , both suffering from back injuries , joined the England squad at training but it was soon clear they had no chance of making the flight to Kishinev on Friday . 
" They had some scans and X-rays yesterday and they 're out , " said Hoddle . 
" The more important thing for me was to get them down here and have a chat . 
To go another five weeks without that chance would have been foolish , " he added . 
Hoddle , who has already lost the services of midfielder Darren Anderton and defender Steve Howey , delayed naming any replacements . 
There was also concern over injuries to Paul Gascoigne , Les Ferdinand and David Batty .
