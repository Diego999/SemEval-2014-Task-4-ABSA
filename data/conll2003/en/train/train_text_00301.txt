Italian farmer says he mutilated four women . 
VERONA , Italy 1996-08-24 
An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday . 
It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women . 
ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them . 
Stevanin , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 . 
Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal . 
Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river . 
Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators . 
It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads . 
Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by .
