HORSE RACING - PIVOTAL ENDS 25-YEAR WAIT FOR TRAINER PRESCOTT . 
YORK , England 1996-08-22 
Sir Mark Prescott landed his first group one victory in 25 years as a trainer when his top sprinter Pivotal , a 100-30 chance , won the Nunthorpe Stakes on Thursday . 
The three-year-old , partnered by veteran George Duffield , snatched a short head verdict in the last stride to deny Eveningperformance ( 16-1 ) , trained by Henry Candy and ridden by Chris Rutter . 
Hever Golf Rose ( 11-4 ) , last year 's Prix de l ' Abbaye winner at Longchamp , finished third , a further one and a quarter lengths away with the 7-4 favourite Mind Games in fourth . 
Pivotal , a Royal Ascot winner in June , may now be aimed at this season 's Abbaye , Europe 's top sprint race . 
Prescott , reluctant to go into the winner 's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced , said : " Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer . " 
He added : " It 's very sad to beat Henry Candy because I am godfather to his daughter . " 
Like Prescott , Jack Berry , trainer of Mind Games , had gone into Thursday 's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession . 
Berry said : " I`m disappointed but I do n't feel suicidal . 
He ( Mind Games ) was going as well as any of them one and a half furlongs ( 300 metres ) out but he just did n't quicken . "
