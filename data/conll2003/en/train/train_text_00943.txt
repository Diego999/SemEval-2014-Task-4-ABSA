ABDERDEEN , Scotland 1996-08-30 
French central defender Antoine Kombouare has completed a 300,000 pounds sterling ( $ 467,000 ) move to Aberdeen from Swiss club Sion , the Scottish premier division club said on Friday . 
Kombouare has signed a two-year contract and will make his debut against Morton in the Scottish League Cup on Tuesday . 
But he will be ineligible for the rest of Aberdeen 's UEFA Cup campaign as he has already played for Sion in this season 's Cup Winners ' Cup . 
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said : " It 's unfortunate for us that Antoine cannot play in Europe but he will help us achieve things in domestic competition . 
" I have been watching him for several weeks now and have no doubts he brings real quality to the side . 
He has a great deal of experience and I 'm sure he will quickly establish himself in both the team and the affection of our fans . " 
The 32-year-old defender played seven seasons with Nantes and was with Paris St Germain for five seasons . 
He said former PSG team mate David Ginola , who now plays for English premier league Newcastle , was influential in his move to Scotland . 
" I 'm a very good friend of David and spoke to him recently about coming to Aberdeen and he was very positive about it , " Kombouare said . 
" He said I would really enjoy life there and that I would settle in in terms of football as well . 
That , and the fact he is only a few hours drive away , influenced my decision to come to Aberdeen . "
