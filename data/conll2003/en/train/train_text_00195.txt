A knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on Friday , killing one girl and wounding three others , police said . 
At about 4 a.m. EDT ( 0800 GMT ) , a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the Camelot subdivision of this eastern Virginia city , when a man entered the house , wielding a knife , threatening to sexually assault the girls . 
Detective Richard Black of the Chesapeake Police Department , said a neighbour , Curtis Lee White II , 19 , was arrested in the attack , but had not been charged by late morning on Friday . 
There were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago , Black said . 
The detective said details were sketchy , but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when White allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes . 
He said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted White , who allegedly stabbed him more than once . 
The other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls , all under 18 , were stabbed , one fatally . 
" At least two of them were sexually molested , " Black said . 
He said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening . 
Police said the girl who died was identified as Michelle Harper . 
Her age was not given .
