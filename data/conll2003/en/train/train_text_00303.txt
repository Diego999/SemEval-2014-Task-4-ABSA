PARIS 1996-08-24 
An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday . 
Algerian security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of Bou Haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of Algiers . 
The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely . 
El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl . 
Several people were also wounded , it said . 
The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife . 
The government-appointed watchdog , Human Rights National Observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years . 
An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .
