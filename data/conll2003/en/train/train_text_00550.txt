CBOE in routine review of MFS options . 
CHICAGO 1996-08-27 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) said on Tuesday it was doing a routine investigation into trading in options on MFS Communications Co Inc shares . 
On Monday , the company said it had agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc in a deal valued at $ 14 billion . 
MFS shares surged on the news while WorldCom fell on fears of dilution . 
The New York Times said on Tuesday some of the options trading in MFS last Friday may suggest insider trading . 
MFS options also trade on the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange . 
A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading . 
" If there is unusual activity , certainly we look at it , but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official , " he said . 
Pacific Stock Exchange officials were not available . 
One trader said trading in MFS options had increased steadily from about mid-August , and doubted whether any of last Friday 's activity was insider trading .
