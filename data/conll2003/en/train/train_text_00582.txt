An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views . 
Rep . 
Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party . 
" But this year is different . 
For the first time , the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said . 
The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party . 
" The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " Hall said . 
At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov . 
Robert Casey , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking . 
Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since . 
Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down . 
Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak . 
" I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " Casey said . 
" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention . 
For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said . 
The Republican Party , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov . 
William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down . 
Bob Dole , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights . 
Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights . 
Kate Michelman , president of the National Abortion Rights Action League , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children . 
" I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth . 
The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain . 
Their answer to choice is control and punishment . 
Our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said . 
Georgia Rep . 
Cynthia McKinney said : " You make your moral decisions . 
I 'll make mine and let 's leave ( Republican House Speaker ) Newt Gingrich out of it . "
