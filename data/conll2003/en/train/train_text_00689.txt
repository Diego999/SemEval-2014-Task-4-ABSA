- Princeton Lyman , the U.S. Under-Secretary of State for International Organisations , will on Wednesday continue his work in Angola visiting Bailundo , where he should be received by Jonas Savimbi , leader of Unita . 
On Tuesday Lyman participated in a meeting of a joint-commission where he considered that the Angolan politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate . 
In his opinion the quartering of Unita forces must be concluded in all the Angolan territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces , the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country .
