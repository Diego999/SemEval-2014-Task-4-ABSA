Colombian peso closes lower , importers buy dlrs . 
BOGOTA 1996-08-26 
Colombia 's peso closed lower at 1,044 after coming under pressure from dollar-buying by importers seeking to meet their commitments abroad , interbank dealers said . 
It was the second consecutive session that saw the peso , which ended at 1,041 Friday , close lower . 
" The ( dollar 's ) rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated , " one dealer said . 
Contributing to the peso 's weakness , another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in Monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market . 
This , according to the trader , was typical of month-end position-squaring -- and the fact that a stronger U.S. currency helps limit some foreign exchange losses . 
Dealers reported 355 trades for a total of $ 142 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 1,037 before heading lower into the close .
