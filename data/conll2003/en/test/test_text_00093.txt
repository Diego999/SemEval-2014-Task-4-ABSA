A bomb exploded on Friday outside the home of a Slovak politician expelled from parliament after he quit the ruling party , complaining of a lack of democracy in the country . 
The official TASR news agency said the explosion blew out all ground floor windows of Frantisek Gaulieder 's family home in Galanta , western Slovakia , and damaged the main entrance , but no-one was injured . 
Gaulieder , formerly a member of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 's ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia , was stripped of his parliamentary mandate on Wednesday after leaving the party last month in protest over what he said was a lack of democracy in the country . 
He said he had been receiving anonymous death threats since making the move . 
" This was an act of terrorism and now I fear not only for my own life , but also of that of my wife and children , " he told TASR . 
Gaulieder 's family was sleeping in a bedroom at the back of the house and were unharmed by the blast . 
It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast .
