BRUSSELS 1996-12-06 
European Union rice experts on Thursday postponed discussion on area aid payments to rice producers because the documents were not available in all the EU languages , an EU offcial said on Friday . 
" The discussion in the experts group had to be postponed because the documents needed to be translated into the official languages and the item will be on next week 's agenda , " the offcial said . 
European rice producers are due to get compensatory area aid payments similar to those paid to cereal producers because of cuts in intervention prices .
