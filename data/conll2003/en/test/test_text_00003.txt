AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 
Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday . 
Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body . 
It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes . 
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal . 
Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute . 
Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal . 
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute . 
A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot . 
Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner . 
Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute .
