British " Euro-sceptic " says Clarke should resign . 
LONDON 1996-12-06 
A " Euro-sceptic " member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency . 
Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year . 
" We have a divided and split Cabinet . 
This cannot endure , " Marlow told BBC television 's Newsnight programme on Thursday . " 
It is not sustainable . 
Kenneth Clarke has to go . 
If he does n't resign , the prime minister has got to fire him . " 
Marlow 's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament . 
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major . 
Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership . 
His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael Heseltine , deputy prime minister . 
Pro-European Conservative MP Edwina Currie told the BBC that if Clarke resigned , other ministers would go with him .
