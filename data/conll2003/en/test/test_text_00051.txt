Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright , who is of Czech extraction , as the United States ' first woman Secretary of State . 
In a statement Havel , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true American of fine origins . " 
" I look forward to continuing our good relations ... 
with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State . 
I wish her well , " Havel said in a statement to Reuters . 
Havel , who helped lead the " velvet revolution " that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989 , invited Albright , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 . 
Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital . 
Albright , born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 . 
As an academic , Albright studied and lectured on Europe 's 20th century problems before becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . 
Czech diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO , praised the selection of Albright , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries . 
" The nomination ... 
is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US , " Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters . 
" ( Albright ) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . " 
Czech ambassador to the United Nations , Karel Kovanda , told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright " is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , " but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs .
