Mussolini 's granddaughter rejoins far-right party . 
ROME 1996-12-06 
Alessandra Mussolini , the granddaughter of Italy 's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , said on Friday she had rejoined the far-right National Alliance ( AN ) party she quit over policy differences last month . 
" I 've gone back , " she told a radio show shortly after AN leader Gianfranco Fini , who was being interviewed on the programme , said the row had been resolved . 
" He did n't want to lose me and I did n't want to lose him . " 
Fini told state radio RAI he met Mussolini thanks to the good offices of Giuseppe Tatarella , AN 's leader in the Chamber of Deputies ( lower house ) , and had overcome their differences . 
Mussolini , 33 , resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons . 
The fiery politician , who is also a niece of screen star Sophia Loren , had accused AN leaders of stifling internal party debate . 
Mussolini , who sits in the Chamber , told La Stampa newspaper last month after quitting AN 's parliamentary party that she was considering joining the neo-fascist Social Movement ( MS-Fiamma ) formed by some of the Duce 's World War Two followers .
