EU , Poland agree on oil import tariffs . 
BRUSSELS 1996-12-06 
The European Union and Poland have resolved disagreements over a new Polish oil import regime , the European Commission said on Friday . 
The EU had objected to increases in Polish tariffs on imports of gasoline and gasoil products introduced on January 1 , 1996 , saying they contravened levels envisaged in the so-called Europe Agreement between the EU and Poland . 
The increases were aimed at protecting the Polish market while helping to modernise the local oil industry . 
" The EU and Poland have now reached a final settlement regarding issues related to the Polish import regime in the oils sector , " the Commission said in a statement . 
Under the agreement , Poland will abolish all oil import tariffs by 2001 , remove all oil price controls and end quantitative restrictions on imports by January 1 , 1997 . 
The agreement includes the early privatisation and modernisation of Polish oil refineries , which will be obliged to offer equal treatment to all buyers . 
The EU and Poland will monitor the settlement at six-monthly meetings .
