WASHINGTON 1996-12-06 
President Clinton aims to hold more news conferences in his second term and will have one Dec. 13 , the White House said Friday . 
The president had only two formal , full-blown news conferences last year , one in January and one after he won re-election in November , although he had various other limited sessions with the press . 
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton " plans to have regular news conferences " during his second term . 
But when asked how frequent these would be , he was evasive , saying , " periodic , occasional . " 
" He enjoys the give and take " with reporters , the spokesman added .
