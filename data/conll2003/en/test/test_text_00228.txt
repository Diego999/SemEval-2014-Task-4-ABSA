MADRID 1996-12-07 
Real Madrid 's Balkan strike force of Davor Suker and Predrag Mijatovic shot their side to a 2-0 win over Barcelona in Spain 's old firm game on Saturday . 
The result leaves Real on 38 points after 16 games , four ahead of Barcelona . 
With just one league match scheduled before the New Year break , Real are also assured of spending Christmas ahead of their arch-rivals . 
A mix-up in the Barcelona defence let Croatian international Suker in midway through the first half , and Montenegrin striker Mijatovic made it 2-0 after fine work by Clarence Seedorf just after the break . 
Barcelona fought back strongly but were twice denied by the woodwork on an unusually quiet night for Brazilian striker Ronaldo .
