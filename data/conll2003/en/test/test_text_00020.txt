CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY . 
MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 
West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday . 
Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . 
The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . 
West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat . 
Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him . 
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . 
On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . 
Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . 
Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take . 
Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper . 
Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings . 
Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago . 
Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . 
Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament .
