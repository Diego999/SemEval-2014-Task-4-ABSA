RUGBY UNION - CUTTITTA BACK FOR ITALY AFTER A YEAR . 
ROME 1996-12-06 
Italy recalled Marcello Cuttitta 
on Friday for their friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection . 
Cuttitta , who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month . 
Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi , who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team . 
Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup , where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages . 
Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback . 
" He ended the World Cup on the wrong note , " Coste said . 
" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available . 
I think now is the right time for him to return . " 
Squad : Javier Pertile , Paolo Vaccari , Marcello Cuttitta , Ivan Francescato , Leandro Manteri , Diego Dominguez , Francesco Mazzariol , Alessandro Troncon , Orazio Arancio , Andrea Sgorlon , Massimo Giovanelli , Carlo Checchinato , Walter Cristofoletto , Franco Properzi Curti , Carlo Orlandi , Massimo Cuttitta , Giambatista Croci , Gianluca Guidi , Nicola Mazzucato , Alessandro Moscardi , Andrea Castellani .
