RUGBY UNION - CAMPESE SIGNS OFF WITH TRY IN WALLABY ROMP . 
LONDON 1996-12-07 
Australia bade farewell to David Campese in spectacular fashion by overwhelming the Barbarians 39-12 in the final match of their European tour at Twickenham on Saturday . 
The Wallabies ran in five tries with Campese , who has retired from test rugby after collecting 101 caps and a world record 64 tries , adding one last touchdown in a Wallaby jersey before departing the international game . 
The Barbarians included 14 internationals but , with only two pre-match practice sessions behind them , proved no real match for a Wallaby side determined to finish their 12-match tour unbeaten . 
The touring team were 27-0 ahead by half-time before easing up in the second-half . 
Full-back Matthew Burke finished with a personal haul of 24 points to take his tour aggregate to 136 .
