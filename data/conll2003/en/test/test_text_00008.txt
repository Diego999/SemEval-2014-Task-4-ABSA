SOCCER - BLINKER BAN LIFTED . 
LONDON 1996-12-06 
Dutch forward Reggie Blinker had his indefinite suspension lifted by FIFA on Friday and was set to make his Sheffield Wednesday comeback against Liverpool on Saturday . 
Blinker missed his club 's last two games after FIFA slapped a worldwide ban on him for appearing to sign contracts for both Wednesday and Udinese while he was playing for Feyenoord . 
FIFA 's players ' status committee , meeting in Barcelona , decided that although the Udinese document was basically valid , it could not be legally protected . 
The committee said the Italian club had violated regulations by failing to inform Feyenoord , with whom the player was under contract . 
Blinker was fined 75,000 Swiss francs ( $ 57,600 ) for failing to inform the Engllsh club of his previous commitment to Udinese .
