TIRANA 1996-12-07 
Albanian coach Astrit Hafizi said on Saturday it was important that his players brush aside the country 's short ban by FIFA in order to concentrate on next Saturday'sWorld Cup group nine qualifier against Northern Ireland . 
World soccer 's governing body reinstated Albania last Tuesday after the Balkan country 's government lifted suspensions on various soccer officials . 
FIFA had banned Albania indefinitely after its sports ministry had ordered the suspension of Albanian Football Association general secretary Eduard Dervishi and dissolved the executive committee . 
" We would be very happy with a draw in Belfast , " said Hafizi . " 
Especially if one takes into consideration our difficult post-suspension situation and the fact Northern Ireland is very keen to win . " 
Regular defender Artur Lekbello , who is injured , was missing from Hafizi 's squad named on Saturday for the Belfast match .
