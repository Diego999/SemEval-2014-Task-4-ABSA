A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday . 
In sentencing Darrel Voeks , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was " a thief by habit . " 
" You are self-indulgent . 
You are narcissitic , " Luebke said at the sentencing , adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him . 
Voeks , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children . 
But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper . 
One stripper said Voeks offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery .
