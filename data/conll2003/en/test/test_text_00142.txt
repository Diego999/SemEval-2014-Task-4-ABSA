Turkey hindered by own landmines on Syrian border . 
ANKARA 1996-12-06 
Turkey 's efforts to prevent Kurdish rebels and smugglers infiltrating from Syria are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said . 
" It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found , " the commission said in a report on border protection . 
The report , to be debated in parliament in coming weeks , was seen by Reuters on Friday . " 
Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces , " it said . 
It said Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces . 
" Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines , defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas . 
They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle , " it said . 
An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment . 
Turkey says Syria sponsors the PKK , fighting for Kurdish self-rule in southeast Turkey . 
Damascus denies aiding the rebels . 
The PKK also crosses into Turkey from bases in the mountains of northern Iraq . 
More than 21,000 people have died in the 12-year-old conflict .
