Indonesia 's Belo leaves for Nobel award ceremony . 
DILI , East Timor 1996-12-06 
East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . 
Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people . 
It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo . 
The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta , who lives in self-exile in Australia . 
The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital . 
" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta ... 
will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East Timor ) , " Alatas said on Friday . 
He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) in Jakarta . 
Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory . 
Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . 
The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move . 
Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo . 
Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved , Alatas replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . " 
Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo , Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope , and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn . 
Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor 's official visit to Indonesia last month , but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta .
