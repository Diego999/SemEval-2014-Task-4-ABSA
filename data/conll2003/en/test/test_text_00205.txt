RUGBY UNION - RETIRING CAMPESE WEIGHS UP OPTIONS . 
LONDON 1996-12-07 
David Campese will consider offers to play club rugby in England but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in Australia . 
The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a Wallaby jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match London side Saracens who have already snapped up Francois Pienaar , Michael Lynagh and Philippe Sella . 
" If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said Campese . 
" I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home . 
I 've also got a contract to play for New South Wales in the Super 12 next year . " 
Former Wallaby captain Nick Farr-Jones believes Campese may yet be tempted to England . 
" I 'm sure there are a few people in England who 'd be delighted to have David Campese in their club 's jersey , " he said .
