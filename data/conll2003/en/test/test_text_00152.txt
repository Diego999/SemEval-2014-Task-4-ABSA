PARIS 1996-12-06 
Moroccan Mohamed Benchaou , the third person to die after a bombing on a Paris train , was a 25-year-old student about to submit a mathematics doctorate , the Moroccan embassy said on Friday . 
Benchaou died of his injuries on Thursday night , two days after the blast . 
A newly-married Canadian woman and a man from New Caledonia died instantly in the bomb that injured 90 others in the rush-hour train . 
An embassy spokesman said Benchaou , the son of a Moroccan army colonel , had been due to take his doctorate in March and hoped to become a teacher . 
Investigators have said the explosion bore the hallmarks of Algerian Moslem fundamentalists who staged a series of bombings last year which killed eight people and injured more than 160 .
