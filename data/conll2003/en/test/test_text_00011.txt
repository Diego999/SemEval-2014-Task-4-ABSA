Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday . 
Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert . 
Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu . 
The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours . 
The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . 
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town . 
" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance . 
On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , Ireland and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game . 
League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt .
