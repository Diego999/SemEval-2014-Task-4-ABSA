German Santa in bank nearly gets arrested . 
HANOVER , Germany 1996-12-06 
A Santa Claus distributing presents to workers in a German bank on Friday nearly ended up behind bars when a passing police patrol thought he was a robber in disguise . 
The man , doing his rounds in the northern city of Hanover on the day when German children traditionally receive small presents from Saint Nicholas , convinced police eventually that he was genuine .
