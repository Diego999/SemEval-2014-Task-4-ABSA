SOCCER - ITALIAN FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND . 
ROME 1996-12-06 
Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT ) : 
Bologna ( 4 ) v Piacenza ( 13 ) 1330 
Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn . 
Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday . 
Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530 
Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega . 
Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer . 
Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330 
Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi . 
Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930 
Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups . 
Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack . 
AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330 
Can Milan sink any further ? 
Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed . 
Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield . 
Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury . 
Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330 
In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala . 
Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini . 
Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330 
Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago . 
Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury . 
Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals . 
Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330 
All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack . 
The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle . 
Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330 
Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless . 
Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws . 
Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano .
