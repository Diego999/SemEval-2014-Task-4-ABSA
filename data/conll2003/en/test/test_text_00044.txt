SOCCER - FIFA BOSS HAVELANGE STANDS BY WEAH . 
ROME 1996-12-06 
FIFA chairman Joao Havelange said on Friday he would personally present AC Milan George Weah with world soccer 's fair play award despite the striker 's attack on Porto captain Jorge Costa . 
In an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport , he was quoted as saying Weah had been provoked into the assault which left Costa with a broken nose . 
" FIFA has named the Liberian for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision , " Havelange said . 
" A reaction , provoked , cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition . 
" I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in Lisbon and I 'm confident that Costa himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand . " 
Weah was suspended for one match by UEFA , European soccer 's governing body , pending a fuller investigation . 
The incident took place in the players ' tunnel after a European Champions ' League match on November 20 . 
Weah has admitted head butting Costa but said he reacted to racist taunts . 
He has offered to apologise if Costa acknowledges the provocation . 
Costa , who needed surgery on his nose , has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing Weah . 
Weah served out his suspension during Milan 's 2-1 home defeat by Rosenborg of Norway on Wednesday . 
The defeat put the Italians out of the Europoean Cup .
