MOSCOW 1996-12-06 
Russia said on Friday it expected a constructive relationship with Madeleine Albright , nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton to be Secretary of State . 
Interfax news agency quoted First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying Moscow was ready for " most active and constructive " work with Albright . 
But he noted that policy would be shaped by Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin . 
Clinton and Yeltsin are due to meet next March for their first summit since both were re-elected . 
" Our countries ' leaders have agreed to meet in March , 1997 . 
The Russian foreign ministry believes the new directions in the development of Russian-U.S. relations will be worked out there , " Ivanov told Interfax . 
Interfax , outlining Albright 's biography , pointed out that she had defended Washington 's interests fiercely as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and that this had included actively supporting NATO 's plans to expand eastwards . 
Russia opposes NATO 's plans to take in countries of eastern and central Europe which used to be part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact , saying such moves would threaten its security .
