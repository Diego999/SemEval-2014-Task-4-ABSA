Albanian jailed for threat of bomb suicide . 
TIRANA 1996-12-06 
An Albanian court on Friday sentenced a man who threatened to blow himself up outside President Sali Berisha 's office to 13 years in jail for guerrilla action and illegal possession of arms . 
Buza last April said he would blow himself up outside the presidential palace unless he was allowed to speak to Berisha , who was at the time meeting Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro . 
Buza was overpowered by riot police less than one hour after he began his action . 
" Evaluating all the conditions of the case the court thinks the sentence should be lower than the minimum ( 15 years ) , " Tirana judge Qazim Gjonaj added . 
The defendant denied the charges , saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan . 
Medical experts had concluded Buza was mentally unstable but fully responsible for the act he had committed , Gjonaj said .
